This was an excercise the the proper handling of memory allocation and 
freeing on heap storage.  The algorithm will read an input file line
by line and and then go to each character and keep track of what type 
it is.  It then adds them to their own array and prints out the amount.
My algorithm seems a little hacky as I use a different counter and iterator
for each type _         _
	       \_('_')_/
